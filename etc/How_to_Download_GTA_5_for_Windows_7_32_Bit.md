You can drive, fly, swim, bike, or walk around the city and the countryside, and encounter various characters, events, and secrets.
 
Another reason why GTA 5 is so popular is its online mode, GTA Online. This mode allows you to create your own character and join up to 30 other players in a shared world. You can cooperate or compete with other players in various activities such as races, deathmatches, heists, businesses, and more. You can also customize your character, vehicles, weapons, properties, and outfits. GTA Online is constantly updated with new content and features by Rockstar Games.
