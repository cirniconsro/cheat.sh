## Step 4: Use the Keep and Delete Brushes to Mask Your Image
 
In Fluid Mask 3.2.5, you will see your image segmented into different regions based on color and texture. You can use the Keep and Delete brushes on the left side of the window to mark which regions you want to keep or delete from your image. The Keep brushes are green and the Delete brushes are red. There are three types of brushes: Exact, Local, and Global. Exact will keep or delete the exact pixels you click on, Local will keep or delete the region you click on, and Global will keep or delete all regions that have similar colors to the one you click on.
 
For this example, we will use the Exact Keep brush to mark the woman's face and hair, the Local Delete brush to mark the background around her, and the Global Delete brush to mark any remaining background areas that have similar colors to the ones we deleted.

## Step 5: Use the Blend Brush to Refine the Edges of Your Mask
 
One of the features of Fluid Mask 3.2.5 is that it can blend the edges of your mask with the background image using intelligent edge detection technology. This is especially useful for fine details such as hair or fur. To use this feature, select the Blend brush from the left side of the window and adjust its size and strength using the sliders below it. Then, brush over the edges of your mask where you want to blend them with the background image.
 
For this example, we will use the Blend brush to smooth out the edges of the woman's hair and make it look more natural.
